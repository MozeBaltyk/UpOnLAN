# UpOnLAN.xyz

**[Features](#features) â€¢ [Get Started](#get-started)**

This project is a cold fork of Netboot.xyz with the goal of unifying and simplifying the upstream into an all-in-one solution. Its main purpose is to provide an editor for iPXE menus and serve them on the fly. Additional features include Wake-on-LAN, PXE menu testing and installation, and a webapp for developing custom PXE menus. PXE booting is especially relevant for automating bare-metal installations and experimenting with new setups.

## Features

This webapp aims to:
- Serve a PXE menu via iPXE with real-time edits
- Serve Assets during PXE install
- Documentation about iPXE and UpOnLAN 
- Provide logs and live system metrics (TFTP, usage, boot activity, etc.)

* A `podman engine` install on linux.

* `nc` package installed
