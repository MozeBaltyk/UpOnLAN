## Assets in UpOnLAN

iPXE gives you a menu, but the menu itself only defines where to boot from. At some point, you need to redirect the client to an actual bootable payload. This could be a public mirror on the Internet, or (in many cases) you'll want to host and serve these assets locally.

## 🔧 What You Need to Live Boot

In simple terms, a typical Live CD (or PXE boot image) requires 3 main components to boot an operating system over the network:

- [x] **Kernel** — The Linux kernel itself, responsible for interacting with the hardware.
- [x] **Initramfs** — A minimal filesystem loaded into RAM that initializes the system before handing off control.
- [x] **SquashFS** — The compressed root filesystem containing the actual operating system the user will run.

The general flow is:
1. The kernel loads.
2. The initramfs is executed, initializing devices and network.
3. The initramfs locates and downloads the SquashFS, loads it into RAM, and finally hands off control to the main OS (often using modern init managers like `systemd` or `upstart`).

## 🚧 Why UpOnLAN Helps

One of the key problems UpOnLAN solves is **making these three components available locally and securely**, even when:

- The original vendor doesn’t provide stable HTTPS downloads.
- The initramfs cannot verify HTTPS endpoints (due to missing CA certificates).
- The target machine cannot access the public Internet at all (offline provisioning).
  
This is why the **Assets** tab exists in the web app:

- ✅ Mirror LiveCDs locally.
- ✅ Serve these assets via HTTPS from your local UpOnLAN instance.
- ✅ Provide helper scripts to extract kernel, initramfs, and squashfs directly from ISO files.
- ✅ Automatically populate an `endpoints.yml` configuration file for your iPXE menus.

This allows you to fully control and serve all necessary assets locally, ensuring reliable and repeatable booting even in isolated environments.
